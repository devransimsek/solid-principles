# SOLID Principles in TypeScript

This project demonstrates violations of the SOLID principles using TypeScript. Each folder contains:

- A `bad.ts` file showing a non-SOLID implementation.
- Your job: Refactor each into a `good.ts` file with an explanation in `README.md`.

## Principles Covered

1. **SRP** – Single Responsibility Principle
2. **OCP** – Open/Closed Principle
3. **LSP** – Liskov Substitution Principle
4. **ISP** – Interface Segregation Principle
5. **DIP** – Dependency Inversion Principle
